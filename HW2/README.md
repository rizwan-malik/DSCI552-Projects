## Homework 2 - Clustering Algorithms
Implement the **K-means** algorithm AND the **Expectation Maximization** algorithm for clustering using a **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)** given the data file that contains 150 2D points. Each row in the file contains the coordinates of a single point.
#### Deliverables:
- Run the algorithms on the data file "clusters.txt" using K, the number of clusters, set to 3.
- Report the centroid of each cluster in K-means; and report the mean, amplitude and covariance matrix of each Gaussian in GMM.
- Compare the results of the two algorithms.
