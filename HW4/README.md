## Homework 4 - Classification & Regression Algorithms
1. Implement the **Perceptron Learning Algorithm** for classification.
   - Consider only the first 4 columns in each row. 
   - The first 3 columns are the coordinates of a point; and the 4th column is its classification label +1 or -1.
   #### Deliverable:
   Run the code on the data file **classification.txt** and report the results (weights and accuracy after the final iteration).
   
2. Implement the **Pocket Algorithm** and run it on the given data file.
   - Consider only the first 3 columns and the 5th column in each row.
   - The first 3 columns are the coordinates of a point; and the 5th column is its classification label +1 or -1.
   #### Deliverables:
   - Run the code on the data file **classification.txt**.
   - Plot the number of misclassified points against the number of iterations of the algorithm.
   - Run up to 7000 iterations. Also, report the results (weights and accuracy after the final iteration).
3. Implement **Logistic Regression** and run it on the points in the given data file.
   - Consider only the first 3 columns and the 5th column in each row.
   - The first 3 columns are the coordinates of a point; and the 5th column is its classification label +1 or -1.
   - Use the sigmoid function ÆŸ(s) = es/(1+es).
   #### Deliverable:
   - Run it on the points in the data file **classification.txt**.
   - Run up to 7000 iterations and report the results (weights and accuracy after the final iteration).
4. Implement **Linear Regression** and run it on the points in **"linear-regression.txt"**.
   - The first 2 columns in each row represent the independent X and Y variables; and the 3rd column represents the dependent Z variable.
   #### Deliverable
   Report the results (weights after the final iteration).
