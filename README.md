Assignments for DSCI-552 Machine Learning for Data Science @ USC

## [Homework 1 - Decision Trees](https://github.com/rizwan-malik/DSCI552-Projects/tree/main/HW1)
Predict whether you will have a good night-out in Jerusalem for the coming New Year's Eve. Assume that you have kept a record of your previous night-outs with the given attributes in the data file.

## [Homework 2 - Clustering Algorithms](https://github.com/rizwan-malik/DSCI552-Projects/tree/main/HW2)
Implement the **K-means** algorithm AND the **Expectation Maximization** algorithm for clustering using a **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)** given the data file that contains 150 2D points. Each row in the file contains the coordinates of a single point.

## [Homework 3 - FastMap & PCA Implementation](https://github.com/rizwan-malik/DSCI552-Projects/tree/main/HW3)
- Use FastMap to embed the objects in fastmap data file into a 2D space based on Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance.
- Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data points in PCA data file from 3D to 2D.

## [Homework 4 - Classification & Regression Algorithms](https://github.com/rizwan-malik/DSCI552-Projects/tree/main/HW4)
- Implement the Perceptron Learning algorithm for classification.
- Implement the Pocket algorithm and run it on the given data file.
- Implement Logistic Regression and run it on the points in the given data file.
- Implement Linear Regression and run it on the points in the given data file.

## [Homework 5 - Feed Forward Neural Networks](https://github.com/rizwan-malik/DSCI552-Projects/tree/main/HW5)
Implement the Back Propagation algorithm for Feed Forward Neural Networks to learn the down gestures from training instances in the given dataset.

## [Homework 6 - Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/rizwan-malik/DSCI552-Projects/tree/main/HW6)
- Find the fattest margin line that separates the points in **linsep.txt**. Using a Quadratic Programming solver report the equation of the line as well as the support vectors.
- Using a kernel function along with the same Quadratic Programming solver, find the equation of a curve that separates the points in **nonlinsep.txt**. Report the kernel function as well as the support vectors.

## [Homework 7 - Hidden Markon Models](https://github.com/rizwan-malik/DSCI552-Projects/new/main/HW7)
Use a Hidden Markov Model to figure out the most likely sequence of values given an observation sequence. At timestep *t* value *v* can be any value from a given domain space.
