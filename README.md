# DSCI552-Projects
Assignments for DSCI-552 Machine Learning for Data Science @ USC

## Homework 1 - Decision Trees
Predict whether you will have a good night-out in Jerusalem for the coming New Year's Eve. Assume that you have kept a record of your previous night-outs with the given attributes in the data file.

## Homework 2 - Clustering Algorithms
Implement the **K-means** algorithm AND the **Expectation Maximization** algorithm for clustering using a **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)** given the data file that contains 150 2D points. Each row in the file contains the coordinates of a single point.

## Homework 3 - FastMap & PCA Implementation
- Use FastMap to embed the objects in fastmap data file into a 2D space based on Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance.
- Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data points in PCA data file from 3D to 2D.

## Homework 4 - Classification & Regression Algorithms
- Implement the Perceptron Learning algorithm for classification.
- Implement the Pocket algorithm and run it on the given data file.
- Implement Logistic Regression and run it on the points in the given data file.
- Implement Linear Regression and run it on the points in the given data file.
